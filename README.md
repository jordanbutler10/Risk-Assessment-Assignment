# üõ°Ô∏è Commercial Bank Risk Assessment - NIST CSF Practice

This project is a cybersecurity risk assessment simulation based on the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**. It demonstrates the process of identifying, evaluating, and prioritizing cybersecurity risks in a banking environment. The assessment uses a **risk register** to assign likelihood, severity, and overall risk scores to five common threat scenarios.

## üìö Scenario Overview

As a new member of a commercial bank‚Äôs cybersecurity team, I was tasked with conducting a basic risk assessment of the operational environment. This included:

- Reviewing potential security risks to systems, data, and business operations
- Assigning **likelihood** and **severity** scores to each risk
- Calculating overall **risk scores** to prioritize security resources
- Documenting findings in a **risk register**

This exercise follows the **Identify** function of the NIST CSF.

## üìã Risk Register Summary

| Risk Description                                        | Likelihood | Severity | Risk Score |
|---------------------------------------------------------|------------|----------|------------|
| Phishing attacks targeting employees                   | 5          | 4        | 20         |
| Insider threat through privileged access misuse        | 3          | 5        | 15         |
| Third-party vendor compromise                          | 4          | 4        | 16         |
| Ransomware infection via infected email attachment     | 4          | 5        | 20         |
| Outdated software on customer-facing banking systems   | 2          | 4        | 8          |

**Top Risks:**  
- **Phishing attacks** and **ransomware infections** (Risk Score: 20) are high-priority threats.  
- **Third-party and insider threats** follow closely and require regular monitoring.  
- **Outdated software** is less likely but still poses a medium-level threat.

## üîê Why It Matters

Understanding how to evaluate risk is foundational for any cybersecurity role. Risk assessments help businesses:

- Identify where they‚Äôre most vulnerable
- Align resources with highest-impact threats
- Reduce the chance of operational, financial, or reputational damage

This activity simulates real-world work you‚Äôd encounter in SOC, GRC, or risk analyst roles.

## üìÅ Files Included

- `risk_register.xlsx` ‚Äì Completed risk register with scoring
- `README.md` ‚Äì Documentation and summary of the project

---

## ‚úÖ Next Steps

- Expand risk register with additional threat vectors (e.g., DDoS, data leakage)
- Align risk mitigation strategies to the highest scored risks
- Map risks to security controls using NIST SP 800-53 or ISO 27001
